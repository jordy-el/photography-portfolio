                        I’m a portraiture photographer, I take pictures of people.

                        Born in East Berlin, grew up in Sussex, England. My first years were spent behind the iron curtain. I now live in New York City. I travel to Europe often.

                        My goal is to show the beauty, grace, strength and enthusiasm of people. I focus on non-models and place regular people in exaggerated situations that highlight an aspect of who they are. I look for a sense of defiance and fortitude in my work.

                        I’m based in New York City but travel for projects around the globe. As well as a bit of photo assisting for Annie Leibovitz in New York and Mario Testino in London, I shoot a lot of portraiture as well as assignments for agencies like Getty Images, WireImage, the Redferns Music Library, Getty Travel and others, including my celebrity portraits over at ContourPhotos.
